# Todo App

A simple, interactive Todo application built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and React.  
It fetches tasks from the JSONPlaceholder API and lets you filter, sort, paginate, and move todos between “Uncompleted” and “Completed” lists with completion timestamps.

## Features

- **Fetch Todos** from `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos`  
- **Filter** by user ID (dropdown affects both lists)  
- **Sort**  
  - Uncompleted todos by title (ascending/descending)  
  - Completed todos by completion date (ascending/descending)  
- **Pagination** on Uncompleted list (“Load more” button)  
- **Mark Complete / Uncomplete** with timestamp for completed items
